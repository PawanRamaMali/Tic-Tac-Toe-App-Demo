### Rules of the Game

* The game is to be played between two people
* One of the player chooses ‘O’ and the other ‘X’ to mark their respective cells.
* The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character (‘O’ or ‘X’).
* If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.

### Winning Strategy – An Interesting Fact

* If both the players play optimally then it is destined that you will never lose (“although the match can still be drawn”). 
* It doesn’t matter whether you play first or second. In another ways – “ Two expert players will always draw ”.
